# family

Our oldest is 8, youngest is 2.
Everyone remains well and cantankerous.

# work

I'm an internal medicine doctor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

In July I'll start cancer fellowship, 
here as well, 
as a member of the [Harrison Society](https://medicine.vumc.org/harrison-society).

Ted Hawkins' song "[Sorry You're Sick](https://youtu.be/jTO-zb6XTzg)" 
reminds me of the book 
[*One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_in_the_Life_of_Ivan_Denisovich)
by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,
and the uncomfortable and sublime truth that all medicine is palliative medicine.
