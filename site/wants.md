# Wishlist

While there are always 
[ten thousand material things](https://rosewhitemusic.com/piano/writings/ten-thousand-things/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Ten%20Thousand%20Things%E2%80%9D%20is,The%20One%20produced%20the%20two.)
I want,
some of which are in the Amazon Wishlist below,
I'm more into digital capability these days.

Probably digital, use-anywhere gift cards are the way to go.
E.g. Visa or MasterCard.

## beau@beauhilton.com

I recently found [fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/), which is a delightful mail service. 
I'm trying to be less reliant on Google, 
and using an independent email client is a big part of that. 
They charge money because 
they're *not* doing all the stuff Google does to keep their products free,
namely, using your info for ad targeting.

 It's $5 a month. I got a few months for free, and really like it. 
 In addition to not selling your data, 
 they have a good facility for having your own email extension (provided you own your domain), 
 so I got `beau@beauhilton.com`.
 Any money toward supporting their service and keeping my cool new email address going would be much appreciated.
 

## beauhilton.com

I use [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/) to host my server, 
which in turn hosts this website.
It's also $5 a month, 
which is a great deal for a server that I fully manage 
and is plenty powerful for a simple website.

Happy to receive any funds to support this going forward.


## Amazon
