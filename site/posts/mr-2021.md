  - BCORL1 48% (ditto)
  - EZH2 93% (?, likely germline w loss of heterozygosity)

## And then...

Diagnosis is... MDS/MPN/MF NOS. 

I.e., who knows.

Started on hydroxyurea and decitabine, c/b recurrent bacteremia, so currently tx on hold.

## TLS

The big idea, and a few finer points.

### Cairo-Bishop classification system

(Most of the following derived from 
[Chapter 4](https://www.asn-online.org/education/distancelearning/curricula/onco/Chapter4.pdf)
of the American Society of Nephrology online 
[Onco-Nephrology curriculum](https://www.asn-online.org/education/distancelearning/curricula/onco/),
which is good and great.)

### Laboratory TLS

Definition: 
Chemotherapy plus the two or more of the following 
within 3d before or 7d after initiation
(so doesn't account for the spontaneous TLS seen in our patient).

| Metabolite/Electrolyte   | Criterion                                  |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------: |
| Uric Acid                | >=8 mg/dL or 25% increase from baseline    |
| Potassium                | >=6mEq/L or 25% increase from baseline     |
| Phosphorus               | >=4.5mg/dL or 25% increase from baseline   |
| Calcium                  | 25% *decrease* from baseline               |


The "25% increase/decrease" part is contested, 
as it may not be clinically meaningful 
if the value stays within the normal range.

### Clinical TLS

| Laboratory TLS and one or more of                          |
| :--------------------------------                          |
| creatinine >= 1.5 ULN (Note: just use AKI criteria)        |
| cardiac arrhythmia or sudden death                         |
| seizure                                                    |

- risk assessment

### Treating TLS

IVF, electrolytes, rasburicase.

Rasburicase is the subject of a recent "Things We Do for No Reason."

[Pay-walled article](https://www.journalofhospitalmedicine.com/jhospmed/article/241443/hospital-medicine/things-we-do-no-reasontm-rasburicase-adult-patients-tumor),
[PDF made available by the authors](https://cdn.mdedge.com/files/s3fs-public/JHM01607424.PDF)

TL;DR: 
the evidence is thin, but could be reasonable to 
- ppx w IVF and allopurinol for low-med risk, 
- use single 3mg dose rasburicase as ppx in high-risk disease (don't use weight-based dosing), 
- tx active TLS (laboratory or clinical) with aggressive fluid resuscitation and electrolyte mgmt, 
possibly single 3mg dose.

Hard outcomes in support of rasburicase are generally lacking, e.g. consistently reducing renal injury, renal failure, length of stay. 

It also seems like the classification criteria need revamping, 
with a larger N.
It's been a while.
However, like redefining fever, 
it's difficult to get a clean slate, 
because we act on the established criteria so aggressively.

## MDS/MPN overlap syndromes

Not much to say here, 
except that the dx is not always clear-cut,
even with BMBx and NGS data,
so the clinical picture matters,
and sometimes we have to shoot in the dark.
