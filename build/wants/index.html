     While there are always <a href="https://rosewhitemusic.com/piano/writings/ten-thousand-things/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Ten%20Thousand%20Things%E2%80%9D%20is,The%20One%20produced%20the%20two.">ten
thousand material things</a> I want, some of which are in the Amazon
Wishlist below, I’m more into digital capability these days.
    </p>
    <p>
     Probably digital, use-anywhere gift cards are the way to go. E.g.
Visa or MasterCard.

     I recently found <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">fastmail</a>,
which is a delightful mail service. I’m trying to be less reliant on
Google, and using an independent email client is a big part of that.
They charge money because they’re <em>not</em> doing all the stuff
Google does to keep their products free, namely, using your info for ad
targeting.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s $5 a month. I got a few months for free, and really like it. In
addition to not selling your data, they have a good facility for having
your own email extension (provided you own your domain), so I got
<code>beau@beauhilton.com</code>. Any money toward supporting their
service and keeping my cool new email address going would be much
appreciated.

     I use <a href="https://www.vultr.com/">Vultr</a> to host my server,
which in turn hosts this website. It’s also $5 a month, which is a great
deal for a server that I fully manage and is plenty powerful for a
simple website.
    </p>
    <p>
     Happy to receive any funds to support this going forward.
