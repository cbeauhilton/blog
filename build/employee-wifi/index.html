    <h1>
     Set Up Enterprise Wifi on Arch Linux
    </h1>
    <p>
     This was a little tricky to get working but very worth it, so here‚Äôs
an outline, mostly for my own later benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
     This post is specific to <a href="https://www.vumc.org">VUMC</a>,
with the VUMCEmployee network.
    </p>
    <p>
     Similar steps should be applicable for other enterprise wifi users,
though this post will unquestionably be out of date before long, and the
intricacies of enterprise wifi are infinite.
    </p>
    <h2>
     VUMCGuest is fine
    </h2>
    <p>
     As with other public networks at large institutions, VUMCGuest is
just a little slow and finicky, and it‚Äôs annoying to have to
re-authenticate repeatedly to use all the HIPAA-compliant things.
    </p>
    <h2>
     VUMCEmployee is better
    </h2>
    <p>
     I‚Äôll probably put a screenshot here at some point comparing speedtest
scores. VUMCEmployee gives over 100 Mbps down, and around 100 up.
    </p>
    <p>
     It‚Äôs also more stable, and latency is around 10ms.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most practical gain, other than faster everything: When I use
VUMCGuest, the keyboard shortcut I use to launch and automatically login
to Epic only works intermittently. On VUMCEmployee, it works reliably.
No more typing! It‚Äôs faster and, again, more reliable than tapping the
badge-readers at the VUMC workstations.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Backend
    </h2>
    <p>
     The personal networking stack of greatest beauty on Linux at this
point is:
    </p>
    <p>
     <code>systemd-networkd</code> +<code>systemd-resolved</code> +
<code>iwd</code>
    </p>
    <p>
     Disable and delete <code>NetworkManager</code> and other such
nonsense, if you are unwise like me and installed conflicting and
useless things.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you‚Äôd like a GUI, <a href="https://github.com/J-Lentz/iwgtk">iwgtk</a> is nice, but the CLI
shipped with <code>iwd</code> (<code>iwctl</code>) is intuitive,
friendly, and well-documented. I keep the GUI version around for quickly
checking on things via a keyboard shortcut, but use the CLI for any
heavy lifting, which has thankfully become rare since landing on this
setup.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Start with VUMCEmployeeSetup
    </h2>
    <p>
     First, log on to the VUMCEmployeeSetup wifi. Then navigate to one of
my favorite websites, <a href="http://neverssl.com/">http://neverssl.com/</a>. This will force
the redirect to the VUMCEmployee enrollment page (I also use this site
for connecting to public wifi at airports, libraries, coffee shops,
etc.). Agree to the terms and conditions. Then click the ‚ÄúShow all
operating systems‚Äù link at the bottom, followed by the ‚ÄúOther Operating
Systems‚Äù tab that pops up at the bottom of the list.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ‚ÄúOther Operating Systems‚Äù tab has three steps listed, which are
simply the pieces that the various installers put together for you. The
first two are downloads for certificates, and the third is a
template.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finding this tab was the gold mine - initially I repackaged one of
the other Linux installers for Arch, because I thought that (since there
was an installer) the process must be complicated, and repackaging
things from Debian-based systems for Arch-based systems is easy enough.
The repackaged version of the installer was decent at first, but it
turns out that the manual process is easier and more reliable. I also
learned more about enterprise networks in the process, which was an
added bonus (I‚Äôm honestly not sure about the sarcasm:sincerity ratio in
the previous sentence).
    </p>
    <p>
     Download the <code>PEM</code> files listed under Steps 1 (root
certificate) and 2 (client certificate).
    </p>
    <h2>
     Make your own <code>iwd</code> profile
    </h2>
    <p>
     Here‚Äôs where it goes:
<code>/var/lib/iwd/VUMCEmployee.8021x</code>
    </p>
    <p>
     Below are the contents, sensitive info redacted, then we‚Äôll go
through some of the key parts and one nicety.
    </p>
    <pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-toml"><span class="hl kwa">[IPv6]</span>
<span class="hl kwb">Enabled</span><span class="hl opt">=</span><span class="hl kwd">true</span>

<span class="hl opt">-----</span>BEGIN CERTIFICATE<span class="hl opt">-----</span>
<span class="hl opt">*</span>lots of gobbledigook goes here<span class="hl opt">*</span>
<span class="hl opt">-----</span>END CERTIFICATE<span class="hl opt">-----</span>
</code></pre>
    <p>
     Most of these options are outlined in Step 3 from the
VUMCEmployeeSetup, cross-referenced against the Arch Wiki page on
<code>iwd</code>, subsection <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd#EAP-PEAP">Network
configuration</a>, and the <a href="https://iwd.wiki.kernel.org/networkconfigurationsettings"><code>iwd</code>
wiki proper</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     An easy-to-miss step: The <code>EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Method</code>
requirement for <code>MSCHAPV2</code> leads to another required install,
check the wiki for current instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Put in your own username and password.
    </p>
    <p>
     My favorite trick in this file is directly embedding the root
certificate in the line <code>EAP-PEAP-CACert=</code> with the syntax
<code>embed:root_cert</code> (any name is fine, doesn‚Äôt have to be
<code>root_cert</code>, it‚Äôs just a pointer). Then you add a definition
of <code>root_cert</code> in a <code>[@pem@root_cert]</code> section.
Insert the contents of the root certificate directly via copy-paste or
<code>cat</code>, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     Easiest method, as root:
    </p>
    <pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-shell">cat /home/beau/dl/root_cert.PEM &gt;&gt; /var/lib/iwd/VUMCEmployee.8021x
</code></pre>
    <p>
     With the direct embed method, you don‚Äôt need to point to the root
certificate file or keep it around at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Needless to say, <code>VUMCEmployee.8021x</code> is a sensitive file
and should be protected appropriately. However, this file or a version
of it is what the automated tools would have made anyway, so there‚Äôs no
special risk here - AND since you did it all yourself you know there was
no funny business coming from a black-box installer.
    </p>
    <h2>
     The other certificate (Client)
    </h2>
    <p>
     I can‚Äôt remember what I had to do with the client cert, probably
added using the Chrome/Firefox certificate managers.
    </p>
    <p>
     I had to do this before when getting set up for VA remote access, the
Arch Wiki comes through again with an article on <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Common_Access_Card">Common Access
Cards</a> that includes instructions on adding certs to browsers.
    </p>
    <p>
     There‚Äôs a chance it‚Äôs not even needed? The <a href="https://iwd.wiki.kernel.org/networkconfigurationsettings">specification</a>
no longer supports adding a client cert field without a key, which I
don‚Äôt have, and do not, apparently, need (see the section ‚ÄúEAP-PEAP with
tunneled EAP-MSCHAPV2‚Äù). At any rate, this setup is working now and I
won‚Äôt futz with it further until something breaks.
