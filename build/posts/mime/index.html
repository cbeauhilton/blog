    <h1>
     fix MIME Types to unbreak RSS feeds served by OpenBSD’s
httpd(8)
    </h1>
    <h2>
     RSS is life - but mine was broken
    </h2>
    <p>
     As of today (2022-11-13) my website lives on an OpenBSD server hosted
at <a href="https://vultr.com">vultr</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s great, delightfully simple and low-resource, robust, extendable,
low-maintenance.
    </p>
    <p>
     I’ve been getting back into RSS lately. Turns out, my own RSS feed
was broken. I knew it was janky, but would have had no idea how broken
it was if not for the great folks on the <a href="https://datasette.io">datasette</a> Discord, one of whom reached
out to let me know my RSS link wasn’t working.
    </p>
    <p>
     This could not stand!
    </p>
    <p>
     I’ve been meaning to fix my RSS feed anyway, and now I had a good
reason.
    </p>
    <h2>
     fixing the file itself
    </h2>
    <p>
     I ended up tearing out my previous RSS solution, <a href="https://romanzolotarev.com/rssg.html"><code>rssg</code></a>, which
is great but made some assumptions about my site’s layout that aren’t
true. I could have rewritten the script, but I’m lazy and a little
strapped for time, so I ended up replacing it with a hand-written RSS
file.
    </p>
    <p>
     (The RSS spec is easy enough to write by hand, a little copy-paste
and replace to add a new article - at some point I’ll probably migrate
to <code>hugo</code> or similar and hand off the feed creation to a more
flexible script, but for now this works).
    </p>
    <p>
     After I was certain the file format was fine and had the info I
wanted, I thought I was good.
    </p>
    <h2>
     fixing the MIME Type
    </h2>
    <p>
     The kind soul who reached out to let me know the RSS feed was
malformed reached out again to let me know he was now getting a MIME
Type error.
    </p>
    <p>
     My feedreader of choice, <code>newsboat</code>, is very forgiving of
what it accepts, and didn’t throw any errors when I tested it.
<code>FreshRSS</code>, on the other hand, is more strict, and the feed
would fail even though the file itself was fine.
    </p>
    <p>
     I looked into it, and found out that <code>httpd(8)</code> only
supports a handful of MIME Types by default, so my server was sending
out <code>application/octet-stream</code> (a generic type) instead of
the <code>rss+xml</code> type, and it was confusing the feedreader.
    </p>
    <h2>
     add all the types
    </h2>
    <p>
     Thank goodness, and as usual in OpenBSD, there’s a very easy way to
add all the relevant types one might need.
    </p>
    <p>
     OpenBSD has an internal MIME declaration file you can link to from
within <code>httpd.conf(5)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here’s the relevant bit, just chuck this on the end of the conf
file:
    </p>
    <pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-shell">
types {
    include "/usr/share/misc/mime.types"
}
</code></pre>
    <p>
     And reload <code>httpd(8)</code>.
    </p>
    <h2>
     great success
    </h2>
    <p>
     Much thanks to my new friend on the Datasette Discord, the fantastic
OpenBSD documentation, as always, and <a href="https://blog.lambda.cx/posts/openbsd-httpd-mime-types/">lambda.cx</a>
for writing a post almost identical to mine (except that his had nothing
to do with RSS - he was fixing PDF serving, which should now be fixed on
my site as well).
