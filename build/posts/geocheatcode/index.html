     Here is background and code
for a trick I use to get
Google to give me best-in-class guesses 
for latitude and longitude,
despite goofy and/or downright bad location searches.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Map all the things
    </h2>
    <p>
     I love maps.
    </p>
    <p>
     Several of my projects involve mapping things at scale.
    </p>
    <p>
     When you want to map a few things, you type searches into Google Maps
and get addresses and/or latitudes and longitudes quickly and
reliably.
    </p>
    <p>
     But what if you‚Äôd like to map 90,000 things whose locations you don‚Äôt
yet know?
    </p>
    <p>
     <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>, as well as
others, provide mapping services you can call programmatically from your
software. You send in some query, such as ‚ÄúVUMC Internal Medicine,‚Äù and
they return information relevant to that query, such as street address
and latitude and longitude. Up to a certain number of queries per day or
hour, the services are free, and since my work is academic, rather than
real-time mapping for some for-profit app, I am happy to send in small
batches to stay under the limits in the free tier.
    </p>
    <p>
     I‚Äôve used these services to make large maps, and they work pretty
well.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>Pretty</em> well.
    </p>
    <h2>
     But mapping is hard
    </h2>
    <p>
     Problems with these services:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
     <li>
      they expected well-formed and reasonable queries
     </li>
     <li>
      if they didn‚Äôt know the answer, the guesses were often wildly off,
or they would refuse to guess at all
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     If I‚Äôm mapping 90,000 things, I‚Äôm going to write some code to go
through each of those 90,000 things and ask the mapping services to
kindly tell me what I want to know. Though I write sanitation code to
clean up the 90,000 things, I‚Äôm not going to quality check each of those
90,000 things. Sometimes things among the 90,000 things are kinda nuts
(misspelled, inclusive of extraneous data, oddly formatted), in
idiosyncratic ways that are impossible to completely cover, no matter
how much code I write to catch the weird cases.
    </p>
    <p>
     I would like a solution that is fairly tolerant of weirdnesses, and
makes good guesses.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Google is really good at search
    </h2>
    <p>
     I noticed that when I manually typed things into the Google Maps
search bar, it forgave a myriad of sins and did a great job centering
the map on its best guess. When I copied and pasted some of the weird
things among the 90,000 into the Google Maps search bar (the same things
that made the official mapping services - including Google‚Äôs - go all
Poltergeist), <em>voila!</em>, the right answer appeared, success rates
nearing 100%.
    </p>
    <p>
     I thought there must be a way to repeat this process with code, in a
scalable way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Turns out there is, and it‚Äôs easy.

    <p>
     Despite having all that extra junk in the query, this returns the
right answer. Because Google is many things good and evil, but of these
one is certain: Google is <em>really</em> good at search.
    </p>
    <h2>
     How does the code work?
    </h2>
    <p>
     If you inspect the source HTML on the Google Maps website after you
search for something and it centers the map on its best guess, and you
scroll way on down (or Ctrl-F search for it) you‚Äôll find
<code>APP_INITIALIZATION_STATE</code>, which contains latitude and
longitude for the place the map centered on.

     <li>
      <a href="view-source:https://www.google.com/maps/search/something+whose+latitude+and+longitude+you+would+like+to+know,+maybe+VUMC+Internal+Medicine/">example
source</a> (you have to copy and paste this link into a new tab
manually, clicking won‚Äôt work)
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     I use the lovely <a href="https://docs.python-requests.org/projects/requests-html/en/latest/"><code>requests-html</code></a>
Python library to send the query to Google, receive the response, and
search through the response for the part I want to extract. Then I use a
little standard Python to parse the extracted part and save the
important bits.
    </p>
    <h2>
     With great power‚Ä¶
    </h2>
    <p>
     Don‚Äôt go crazy with this.
    </p>
    <p>
     The trick is good for leisurely automation of location retrieval when
you have squirrelly queries.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you need real-time mapping of many things, you don‚Äôt want this
solution. Use the actual APIs, and work instead on formatting the
queries properly before sending them to Google/OSM.
    </p>
    <p>
     Also, if you try to query too much/too quickly, Google will shut you
out after a little while. Put a few seconds of delay between each
request and run it overnight and/or in automated batches.
    </p>
